\##### Training the pneumonia-detecting CNN according to this keras guide: https://keras.io/examples/vision/xray\_classification\_with\_tpus/

\##### This notebook was run on google colab with runtime GPU T4.

\##### the code is the same as the one presented in the keras guide, we only added two things:

\##### - fix random seed for reproducibility

\##### - save the model and training history to disk
